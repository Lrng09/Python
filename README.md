# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python. The goal is to prepare the data for further analysis by identifying inconsistencies, handling missing values, and generating visual insights.

## Background

This is raw personal finance data â€” exported Vanguard. Over several years, changes in formatting, column structures, and missing entries can make direct analysis difficult. This project addresses the challenge of cleaning and analyzing such data to better visualize patterns and trends in personal investment decisions.

## Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** 
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** 
- **Jupyter Notebook**
  
## Analysis

The analysis process included:

- Inspecting the structure of the dataset
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Converting data types where necessary
- Exploratory visualizations
