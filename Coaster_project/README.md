# Coaster Project

## Project Overview

### This project aims to explore a dataset of global roller coasters to identify patterns, trends, and insights into their characteristics.

## 1. Data Understanding
- Loading the coaster dataset and inspecting its structure:
- Checked the shape and basic statistics
- Previewed sample rows 
- Noted missing values or duplicate columns

## 2. Data Preparation
- Dropping non-informative columns
- Removing duplicated entries
- Renaming columns for consistency and easier reference
- Data types were formatted

## 3. Univariate Analysis
- Histograms revealed typical ranges for coaster speeds, heights, and number of inversions.
- Boxplots helped identify outliers and understand feature spread.

## 4. Multivariate Analysis
- A correlation heatmap showed strong relationships, particularly between height and speed.
- Scatterplots and pairplots helped visualize trends between numerical features.


## Conclusion
- Height and speed are positively correlatedâ€”taller coasters tend to be faster.
- Material type significantly affects the design and characteristics of a coaster.
- Over time, in recent years, coasters have become more extreme in height and speed - likely driven by technological advances and competition.

This project demonstrates the power of data exploration in understanding real-world phenomena and provides a foundation for more advanced modeling or business insights (e.g., predicting coaster popularity or safety metrics).
